# Breakoutgame
You have to submit all classes and interfaces of your implementation, all of which must reside in package `breakout`.

In addition to the methods specified above, you may add any additional methods you deem useful to any of these classes.
You may also add additional classes or interfaces that you find useful.

For this Part, you must write complete formal documentation for all classes, methods and interfaces you add as part of this assignment.
Make sure to respect behavioral subtyping. (Note: behavioral subtyping is not in the scope of course H02C5A; students of course H02C5A need not consider it.)

We also expect you to write a test suite for all classes you add, which tests the expected behavior of your implementations.
